# CodSoft Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects completed during my internship at CodSoft. Each task demonstrates different skills in Python, ranging from AI and machine learning to GUI development.

## Task 1: Chatbot (`Task_1/chatbot.py`)
A simple rule-based chatbot that interacts with users via the command line. It responds to greetings, provides the current time, and answers basic questions.

---

## Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI (`Task_2/X_O.py`)
A GUI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays against an AI opponent. The game features multiple difficulty levels and a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.

## Task 3: Image Caption Generator (`Task_3/image.py`)
A Python script that uses a deep learning model (BLIP) to generate captions for images. It demonstrates the use of pre-trained transformers and image processing libraries.

---

## Task 4: Movie Recommendation System (`Task_4/recommend.py`)
A GUI application that recommends movies based on genre similarity using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. The interface is built with Tkinter.

---

## Task 5: Face Detection & Recognition (`Task_5/recorgtion.py`)
A real-time face detection and recognition system using a webcam. It leverages OpenCV and face_recognition libraries, with a simple GUI for user interaction.
